# Output Folder

This folder contains the performative images generated by Gemini for users who sign in through the app.

## How it works

1. When a user successfully signs in and their image is converted by Gemini, it's automatically saved here
2. Files are named `performative_<timestamp>.png` where timestamp is Unix epoch time
3. The latest image can be accessed via the `/outputs/latest` API endpoint
4. Individual images can be accessed via `/outputs/<filename>`

## Usage

The Performative Pac game automatically uses the latest image from this folder (or the user's personal saved image) as the Pac-Man character.
